# Free Music Sources for Lofi Player

## Option 1: Freesound.org API (Recommended)
- **Pros**: Free, no rate limits, CC-licensed music
- **Cons**: Smaller library, need to curate lofi tracks
- **API**: https://freesound.org/docs/api/
- **Rate Limit**: 2000 requests/day (free)

## Option 2: Free Music Archive (FMA)
- **Pros**: Curated free music, good quality
- **Cons**: No streaming API, need to download and host
- **Website**: https://freemusicarchive.org/
- **License**: Creative Commons

## Option 3: Jamendo API
- **Pros**: Free streaming, good API, CC-licensed
- **Cons**: Limited lofi genre selection
- **API**: https://developer.jamendo.com/
- **Rate Limit**: 10,000 requests/day (free)

## Option 4: Multiple YouTube Alternatives
- **Pros**: Bypass single API limits
- **Cons**: Complex implementation
- **Sources**: YouTube, SoundCloud, Bandcamp

## Option 5: Pre-curated Lofi Playlist (Hybrid)
- **Pros**: Best user experience, no API limits during playback
- **Cons**: Initial setup required
- **Method**: Download CC-licensed tracks, host on CDN

## Recommended Approach: Multi-Source Strategy

### 1. Primary Source: Pre-curated CC-Licensed Tracks
### 2. Fallback: Multiple Free APIs
### 3. Cache Strategy: Local storage for offline play

Would you like me to implement:
A) Jamendo API integration (easiest, good rate limits)
B) Multi-source approach with fallbacks
C) YouTube with multiple API keys rotation
D) Pre-curated CC-licensed tracks from Free Music Archive

Please let me know which approach you prefer, and I'll create the implementation.
