# Lofi Music Player Implementation

## Overview
This implementation provides a simple lofi music player integrated into your Study Buddy app. When you press the play button, it will start playing lofi music from a predefined playlist.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. `app/src/main/res/raw/playlist.json`
- Contains the playlist with track metadata (title, artist, url, coverArtUrl, duration)
- Currently uses SoundHelix demo tracks - replace with actual lofi music URLs
- Dynamic playlist that can be updated without app changes

### 2. `app/src/main/java/com/example/studybuddy/LofiMusicService.kt` (Modified)
- Updated to load tracks from `playlist.json` instead of hardcoded tracks
- Added Gson JSON parsing
- Improved error handling with fallback tracks
- Updated LofiTrack data class to match JSON structure

### 3. `app/build.gradle.kts` (Modified)
- Added Gson dependency: `implementation("com.google.code.gson:gson:2.10.1")`

## How to Use

### Step 1: Navigate to Pomodoro Fragment
- Open the app and go to the Pomodoro timer section
- You'll see music controls at the bottom of the screen

### Step 2: Press Play Button
- Click the play button (‚ñ∂) to start playing lofi music
- The current track name will be displayed above the controls
- Music will continue playing in the background

### Step 3: Control Playback
- **Play/Pause**: Toggle music playback
- **Next Track (‚è≠)**: Skip to next track in playlist
- **Previous Track (‚èÆ)**: Go back to previous track
- **Shuffle (üîÄ)**: Jump to a random track

### Step 4: Notifications
- Music controls appear in the notification bar
- You can control playback from notifications even when app is closed

## Customizing the Playlist

### Option 1: Update playlist.json
1. Edit `app/src/main/res/raw/playlist.json`
2. Replace URLs with actual lofi music streaming URLs
3. Update track metadata (title, artist, duration)
4. Rebuild the app

### Option 2: Use External API
- The existing multi-source services (Jamendo, Freesound, etc.) can be integrated
- Replace the static JSON loading with API calls
- See `multi-source-music-service.js` for reference

## Free Music Sources

### Recommended Sources:
1. **Jamendo** - Free Creative Commons music
2. **Freesound** - User-generated CC sounds
3. **Archive.org** - Public domain music
4. **YouTube** - With proper API integration

### Current Demo URLs:
- Uses SoundHelix demo tracks (not actual lofi music)
- Replace with actual lofi streaming URLs for production

## Technical Details

### Service Architecture
- `LofiMusicService` runs as a foreground service
- Provides music controls in notification
- Survives app lifecycle changes
- Automatic track progression

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback to default tracks if JSON loading fails
- Network error handling for streaming
- Media player error recovery

### Performance
- Lazy loading of playlist
- Efficient JSON parsing
- Background streaming
- Minimal battery impact

## Testing

### Quick Test:
1. Build and run the app
2. Go to Pomodoro Fragment
3. Press the play button
4. Verify music starts playing
5. Test all control buttons

### Troubleshooting:
- Check logcat for "LofiMusicService" logs
- Verify internet connection for streaming
- Ensure proper permissions in AndroidManifest.xml

## Next Steps

### For Production:
1. Replace demo URLs with actual lofi music
2. Add proper error handling for network issues
3. Implement caching for offline playback
4. Add volume controls
5. Integrate with external music APIs

### Enhancements:
- Visual equalizer
- Sleep timer
- Playlist management
- User favorites
- Custom track upload

## Usage Summary

**Simple Usage**: Just press the play button in the Pomodoro Fragment - that's it! The music will start playing automatically from the predefined playlist.

The implementation handles everything else (track loading, playback control, notifications, error handling) behind the scenes.
